## Task assignments

Some of our group members were totally unfamiliar with the concept of RNA-velocity and the project's overall goal, so it was pretty hard to assign tasks fairly. Also, since most of our work was using other tools, some of my fellows (including me) were unfamiliar with developing bash scripts and running programs from the command line. Task assignment in our group was arbitrary because we did not communicate well at first and did not plan the steps (and their dependencies) we should do to deliver the project. We could have done better in identifying the steps of our analysis, the person responsible for performing that, and in which stages we need to communicate as a group to solve problems. However, it's easier to say than do! You could not anticipate the difficulties of a project and challenges at first glance.

## My contributions

- Helped develop the project idea
- Wrote the initial project proposal and part of the final proposal
- Found the datasets for our analysis
- Tidying and cleaning the GitHub repository
- Re-performing the whole analysis to make sure everything runs smoothly

## Challenging moments

I could say finding a suitable dataset for our analysis was the most challenging step. We went through multiple studies to see whether they have reported spliced/unspliced counts as well as information about the time points. We were giving up the idea, but we were able to find the closest that was possible. In the end, we could not find any correlation between the RNA-velocity and log2 fold change of expression across genes. Still, however, we were able to identify the downfalls of our analysis and where we could do better to find more significant results.

## Members of different backgrounds

It was challenging at first because not all members fully understood the idea of the project and the RNA-velocity concept. But it was really valuable to be able to see their opinions on different parts and communicate with them to all have a better understanding of the analysis and its downfalls.

## Lessons learned

As I mentioned, I found good task management in a project in which many people are involved really important. Also, in such a project, I learned that everyone should inform others of the challenges they face - especially when there are multiple backgrounds in the group because they might have a very different take on the problem that might be helpful to consider.

## Other comments

- A better assessment of the contribution of each individual
- A better overview of what is expected as the results
- Requering a work plan for the project (e.g., timeline)
