## Task assignments

Some of our group members were totally unfamiliar with the concept of RNA-velocity and the project's overall goal, so it was pretty hard to assign tasks fairly. Also, since most of our work was using other tools, some of my fellows (including me) were unfamiliar with developing bash scripts and running programs from the command line. Task assignment in our group was arbitrary because we did not communicate well at first and did not plan the steps (and their dependencies) we should do to deliver the project. We could have done better in identifying the steps of our analysis, the person responsible for performing that, and in which stages we need to communicate as a group to solve problems. However, it's easier to say than do! You could not anticipate the difficulties of a project and challenges at first glance.
